1. **This is a bot is a parody Elon Musk with his ridiculous bad opinions. This bot is NOT an endorsement to Elon Musk.**

**I like this 
[comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r0yi9l/comment/hm8222t/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) 
and the entire thread since that it has so much mish-mash of unrelated comments (including mine) and the absurdity makes it so much funnier.**

3. Output:
```
len(comments)= 473
len(top_level_comments)= 226
len(replies)= 247
len(valid_top_level_comments)= 180
len(not_self_replies)= 246
len(valid_replies)= 246

valid_comments= 426

4. **I believe that I've completed the required tasks, Credit 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 (both parts); did NOT complete Credit 5 (Bot Army) and Markovify. My estimated score is 34/30.**

**Note: However, for Credit 1, 2, and 3, the vast majority of my valid comment were made on r/BotTown (which was around 700-800), which the progress was lost due to the subreddit being banned later. If possible, I may prove that I did so in whichever way you prefer.**

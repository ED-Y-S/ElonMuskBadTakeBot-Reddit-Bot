## 1. **This is a bot is a parody Elon Musk with his ridiculous bad opinions. This bot is NOT an endorsement to Elon Musk.**

2.`https://www.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r0yi9l/comment/hm8222t/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3` I like this comment and the entire thread since that it has so much mish-mash of unrelated comments (including mine) and the absurdity makes it so much funnier.

I believe that I've completed Credit 3, 4, and 7. However, for Credit 3, the vast majority of my valid comment were made on r/BotTown, which was banned later. If possible, I may prove that I did so in whichever way you prefer.
